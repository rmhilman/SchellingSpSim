# SchellingSpSim
Developed on Schellingâ€™s original model of segregation, this agent-based model (ABM) simulation takes into account spatial projection. It allows further analysis on the intertwined effect raised by individual preference over homophilic composition in the local neighbouhood and spatial embeddedness.
